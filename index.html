      <h2><em>RECITAL FEE</em></h2>
      <h3>Although we will be holding the recital at my house, I still need to charge the recital fee, as I will be hiring professional sound engineer as well as well as professional musicians to play in the band. The recital fee will be $35/student performing.
      </h3>
      <h2><em>POTLUCK BBQ</em></h2>
      <h3>This will be a potluck BBQ. I will be sending out a sign-up list towards the end of the week off food and other items that will be needed. </h3>
      <h2><em>VOLUNTEERS</em></h2>
      <h3>I need 2-4 volunteers who would be willing to grill burgers and hot dogs. Please let me know ASAP!!!</h3>
      <h2><em>RSVP</em></h2>
      <h3> Please RSVP with the number of people who you are bringing, including the student. This will help me determine what needs to be brought for food. </h3>
      <h2><em>THEME</em></h2>
      <h3>Classic Cars and Rock n' Roll!!! I have at least two other students who are planning on bringing their classic cars. If you or a family member have a classic car and would like to come show it off, please let me know ASAP!!! Parking in the driveway
        and in front of the house will be reserved for the classics! It will be fun to show off our cars! </h3>
